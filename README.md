# Linux Keylogger with Server (HTTP Transmission)

## Overview  
A Linux kernel-mode keylogger that captures keyboard inputs and sends them to a C# server via HTTP.  

## Key Features  
- **Kernel-mode driver** – Captures keystrokes at the system level.  
- **HTTP communication** – Sends logged data to a remote C# server.  
- **Learning experience** – Helped me understand kernel development and low-level input handling in Linux.  

## Purpose  
This project was primarily an educational exercise in writing software for the Linux kernel
